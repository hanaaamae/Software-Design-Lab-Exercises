In fact everything in our store must go in the next two weeks regardless of cost. $60,000 worth of\nmerchandise must be sold in this short space of time. This includes thousands of dollars worth of new spring goods, such as ladies\nsuits, coats, skirts, wash goods, embroideries, laces and articles too numerous to mention.\nEVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS GREAT SALE\nPeople from far and wide are planning to attend. Our sales force will be greatly increased and we are going to try and wait on and please\neveryone to the best of our ability.

She was, as yet, a novice in the teaching profes\nsion, and it was her first year on the Llano Estacado, so\nthis was the first prairie fire she had seen, though she had\nheard of the dreaded prairie fires that caused great\ndamage, destroying the grass, the only sustenance of the\ngreat herds of cattle that roamed its vast expanse.\nThere was much surmising among the children as to how\nthe fire got out, where it would end, the fire guards it\nwould jump, and much more to the same effect.\nRoy Smith volunteered the information, \"Teacher, the\nfire started at Mr. Gaines'es, I seen it through the window\nwhen it first got out. 'Taint been more'n ten minutes ago,\nMrs. Gaines was washing and a spark blew from under the\nwash pot and set the grass.\"\nFor once Roy's grammar went uncorrected.\nNow, men on horseback rode swiftly past the school in\nthe direction of the fire. It is the custom on the plains,\nwhen a fire is seen, for everyone that lives within sight\nof it to go and assist in extinguishing it; this being the\ncase, fires are often checked before they have done great\ndamage.\nToday, the task of extinguishing the fire would be no\neasy one, as a stiff breeze was blowing, and under such\nconditions fire guards or ploughed furrows around the\nfences would prove ineffectual in stopping it, as the wind\nwas strong enough to blow the sparks a distance of sever\nal yards.\nAs Maura stood in the yard with her pupils, watching\nthe onward rush of the fire, she noticed a tiny patch of\nfire on the edge of the burned patch nearest the school.\n\"It's broke out fresh,\" exclained Jim West, one of the\noldest pupils, a boy of sixteen.", "batch": "okhi_beaver_ver01", "title_normal": "indian advocate.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/45043535/1909-07-01/ed-1/seq-26.json", "place": ["Oklahoma--Pottawatomie County--Sacred Heart"], "page": "258"}, {"sequence": 1, "county": ["Cascade"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Eleven no. a year", "id": "/lccn/sn86075096/1956-10-01/ed-1/seq-1/", "subject": ["Agriculture--Montana--Newspapers.", "Agriculture.--fast--(OCoLC)fst00801355", "Great Falls (Mont.)--Newspapers.", "Livestock--Montana--Newspapers.", "Livestock.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01000722", "Montana.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01207555"], "city": ["Great Falls"], "date": "19561001", "title": "Montana farmer-stockman.

Standing by the rural fire\ntruck is Charles Jewett, chief of the Wibaux fire and rescue squad. (MF-S photo)\nSOMETIME AGO the Wibaux rural vol\nunteer fire department answered a call to a\nfarm home 25 miles away. They had water\non the fire within 30 minutes after receiving\nthe call. While they were unable to save the\nhome, the fire was kept from spreading to\nthe farmer's hay supply and other buildings.\nShortly afterward another call was an\nswered to a farm 26 miles from Wibaux. A\npropane-fed fire was raging in the basement.\nThe volunteers were on the scene within 35\nminutes and confined the damage to the\nbasements, joists and sub-flooring.\nCan a rural fire fighting unit stationed\nat a central location give protection to farms\nmany miles away? The folks in Wibaux\ncounty have had convincing proof that it\ncan.\nRural Department\nThe Wibaux rural fire department has\nbeen in service since 1953 and is an out\ngrowth of the volunteer department in the\ntown of Wibaux. Prior to 1949 Wibaux's fire\nfighting equipment consisted of four hand\ndrawn hose carts of pre-World War I vin\ntage and some chemical tanks. Insurance\nrates in the town were based on \"no fire\nprotection.\"\nWibaux's present volunteer fire depart\nment was organized in 1948. The purchase\nof a new fire truck was authorized and they\nreceived delivery on it in May of 1949.\nA short time later Wibaux experienced\nan elevator fire, the worst fire disaster in\nthe history of the town. The volunteers were\nunable to control the blaze, but if it hadn't\nbeen for the new equipment and trained\nmen to operate it, the fire would have\nspread to the REA pole yard where $7,000\nworth of poles were stored, a gasoline bulk\nstation and the town's coal shed.\nOut-of-Town Fires\nWhether Wibaux county began to ex\nperience more fires than usual, or fires that\nnormally would have gone unnoticed before\nwere being brought to attention through the\nvolunteer fire department, is unknown. But\nthe Wibaux volunteers were being called to\nassist with many fires outside the town.\nSince insurance on the fire truck is invalid\nCOVERS MONTANA AND NORTHERN WYOMING\noutside the city limits, the truck could not\ngo to these fires. The volunteers would load\nwhat equipment they could on pickups and\ngo out and fight the blaze.\nThe need for a truck for rural fire pro\ntection in the county soon became apparent\nand, with donations and help from the\nCounty Commissioners, volunteer fire fight\ners and the Rural Fire Wardens, a truck\nwas bought to be used exclusively for rural\nfire protection.\nFully Equipped\nIt's equipped with a 500-gallon water\ntank, 250 gallon-per-minute high pressure\npump, two high pressure booster hoses with\n250 feet on each reel, 500 feet of IVa-inch\nhose, fire beaters for grass fires, fog nozzles,\nax, bar, ladder, five 5-gallon back packs,\nshovels, litter carrier, rescue rope and two\nsmoke masks.\nThe cost of such a unit would normally\nrun around $10,000, according to Charles\nJewett, chief of the Wibaux Fire and Rescue\nSquad. By buying the truck chassis, having\nthe body built to their own specifications at\na local body shop and by buying the equip\nment separately, Wibaux county was able to\nget its truck for $6,500.\nThere are 24 volunteers on the Wibaux\nFire Department. Ten men go with the rural\ntruck when answering calls in the county \u00ab\nand the rest remain in town to man the city\ntruck, should a fire break out. They meet\nonce a month for training sessions and prac\ntice drills in the use of the equipment.\nTeamwork\nJust as teamwork is an important factor\nin efficient use of fire fighting equipment,\ncooperation between other rural fire de\npartments has shown its value in providing\nrural fire protection. The roof of a two\nstory farm house was struck by lightning\nduring a freak storm last March.\nJewett says the house was equipped with\nproperly installed lightning rods, but the\nground was too dry to ground the lightning.\nIt knocked out the entire electrical system\nof the house, followed the service wires to\na pole and disin- (continued on page 6)\n_\nhires\nthe\nFife?.\nF\nI\nI\nS\ni\nfe\np\nr\nj|\nI\nJ:\nI\nW ibaux Rural Volunteer\nFire Department Has Pro\ntected Farms 20 to 30\nMiles Away\ni\nn\n&\nAc\n'V,\n<\u25a0\ni\n^||rc ^\nFIRE PREVENTION WEEK * OCTOBER 7*13", "batch": "mthi_eveningprimrose_ver01", "title_normal": "montana farmer-stockman.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86075096/1956-10-01/ed-1/seq-1.json", "place": ["Montana--Cascade--Great Falls"], "page": ""}, {"sequence": 33, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045433/1922-07-30/ed-1/seq-33/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19220730", "title": "The Washington herald.
